# Microsoft DAPR (Distributed Application Runtime)

- **Service-to-Service Communication**: DAPR facilitates secure, reliable communication between services using HTTP, gRPC, or other protocols.
- **State Management**: It offers APIs for managing state in a distributed application, abstracting away the complexity of dealing with distributed storage solutions.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: DAPR enables publish/subscribe messaging across microservices using various messaging systems (like Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **Bindings**: DAPR supports integration with external systems (e.g., databases, cloud services) via input/output bindings, simplifying event-driven architectures.
- **Observability**: It includes tools for tracing, logging, and monitoring distributed applications.

DAPR is platform-agnostic and works with <span v-mark.underline.orange>any programming language. </span>
